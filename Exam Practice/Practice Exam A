Question:

You have a Lifecycle Storage policy that moves blobs from hot storage to cool storage if they have not been modified in 30 days. You realize that there is a frequently accessed file that is in cool storage due to this policy, and you'd like to save money by moving it back to hot storage. So you manually move this file back to hot storage. Will this solve your problem?

A. No, the blob will be automatically moved back to cool storage the next day

B. Yes

Correct Answer: A. No, the blob will be automatically moved back to cool storage the next day

Explanation:

Moving the blob from cool to hot does not modify it's modification date, and so it will be moved back to cool storage the next time lifecycle management runs. You need to either modify the rule to be based on last access date, or modify the file when moving it back so that the modification date is updated. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal

Question:

When deploying an Azure Storage account, and you choose Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS), how many copies of your data does Azure keep?

A. 1

B. 3 copies in each Availability Zone

C. 6

D. 3

Correct Answer: D. 3

Explanation:

Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures. Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy

Question:

Which feature of Azure functions allow you to use a runtime not currently supported natively by Azure?

A. Durable Functions

B. Serverless Functions

C. SignalR

D. Custom Handlers

Question:

Your company has several applications running on Azure App Services - App1, App2, App3 and App4. Each application is configured to use a system-managed identity to access resources. Your applications all store their secrets in a KeyVault named KV1. You are finding it difficult to manage the permissions for all these applications, and would like to move to a single managed identity for all applications instead of each application having their own. What action do you take to implement that?

A. Create one user in Azure Active Directory for each application, and have the applications use that

B. Create one user in Azure Active Directory for all applications, and have the applications use that

C. Change the applications to the same user-managed identity

D. Change the applications to the same system-managed identity

Correct Answer: C. Change the applications to the same user-managed identity

Explanation:

Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Azure AD tokens. For example, an application may use a managed identity to access resources like Azure Key Vault where developers can store credentials in a secure manner or to access storage accounts. You cannot configure multiple applications to use the same system-assigned identity. You must use a user-assigned identity for this purpose. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview

Question:

Which type of data can most benefit from being stored in a caching system like Azure Redis Cache?

A. Data that is infrequently read but is static

B. Data that is repeatedly read, and can return a different value every time

C. Data that is repeatedly written

D. Data that is repeatedly read

Correct Answer: D. Data that is repeatedly read

Explanation:

Data that is static but read frequently benefits most from being cached, because you can use the cache to retrieve the data instead of having to go back to the original data source every time. Data that is written and never read does not need to be cached since caching only benefits reading. Data that is always changing (like a stock price) cannot be cached since you always have to go back to the original source to retrieve the latest. Data that is infrequently read but is static can benefit from caching, but it does not benefit the most of the four options. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/caching?toc=%2fazure%2fredis-cache%2ftoc.json

Question:

If your Azure solution relies on third-party public images, some risks are added to your process.
